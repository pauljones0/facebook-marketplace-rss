description: Persona-Driven Codebase Improvement
---

This workflow guides the AI in continuously improving the codebase by adopting specialized expert personas, issuing targeted tasks for them, and meticulously ensuring that all living documentation remains up-to-date with any changes made.

1. **Codebase & Documentation Analysis**: Review the current state of the codebase thoroughly, with a specific focus on the four core living documents (`README.md`, `design.md`, `spec.md`, and `requirements.md`). Understand the architecture, the goals, and the current pain points of the project.
2. **Identify Valuable Personas**: Based on the analysis, recommend 3-5 distinct, specialized personas that would provide the most value right now (e.g., Senior Security Engineer, Principal Frontend UX/UI Designer, Senior DevOps/SRE, Cloud Optimization Expert). 
3. **Draft Persona Task Lists**: For each identified persona, define a specific set of actionable, high-impact tasks they should execute to improve the codebase strictly within their area of expertise.
4. **User Review & Refinement**: Present the proposed personas and their respective task lists to the user for approval or modifications. Wait for the user's explicit confirmation before proceeding further.
5. **Cycle Through Personas**: Iterate through each approved persona one by one. For each persona:
   - **Adopt the Persona**: Confidently take on the specific expertise, mindset, and perspective of the current persona.
   - **Execute Tasks**: Implement the code changes required to complete the persona's assigned tasks. Take your time to write excellent, production-ready code.
   - **Synchronize Living Documents**: Immediately after making code changes, rigorously review and update `README.md`, `design.md`, `spec.md`, and `requirements.md` to perfectly reflect the new implementation details, architectural shifts, and satisfied requirements. NEVER skip this step.
   - **Review & Handoff**: Present a concise summary of what the current persona accomplished, including links to the updated code and documentation. Ask the user if they would like to refine the work or move on to the next persona. Wait for user input.
6. **Overall Project Cohesion Check**: After all personas have completed their passes, perform a final holistic review to ensure that optimizations from different personas do not conflict and the project functions cohesively.
